# ampreact
âš¡âš› [AMP HTML][], [Next.js][], [React][], [styled-components][], [GraphQL][],
and [TypeScript][] â€” The most trendy website boilerplate possible.

## About

The core of `ampreact` is built on [Next.js][], used for all the routing and
serving of pages. For styling, [styled-components][] makes it easyâ€”with
just a small modification to the rendering of the `<style />` tags generated,
it works nicely with [AMP HTML][]. Finally, [`react-amphtml`][]
is used for rendering all of the [AMP HTML][] built-ins, extensions, and
the `<script />` tags needed to use them.

The pages generated should all by properly validated by [AMP HTML][] ðŸ’¯
